The first strange choice was keeping the login button on the homepage, instead of going directly to the sign-in page. I did this because I didn't know how to make index.php the homepage.

The second thing is making all of the entries in the search form mandatory, and this was because there were too many combinations to account for if any were left blank, and this would have exponentially increased the amount of work I would have had to do.
